Sam is currently a research assistant under the mentorship of [Dr. Shalaila Haas](https://github.com/shalailahaas) and Dr. Muhammad Parvaz. He graduated from the University of Minnesota with a Bachelors of Science in psychology and minors in integrative neuroscience and philosophy. In his undergraduate studies, Samâ€™s research focused on the use of fMRI data analysis to identify early visual processing differences found with schizophrenia. His primary research interests lie in using computational methods to uncover the relationship between the physical brain and behavioral outcomes. 

Sam Was hired in the fall of 2024 at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai as a research assistant. There, he is working to parse heterogeneity in neurophsyciatric disorders through computational modeling with the hopes of better understanding disease progression and treatment efficacy. Sam ultimately hopes to advance the field of precision medicine for mental disorders through study and understanding of the brain and the dissemination of knowledge.
